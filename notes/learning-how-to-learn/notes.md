# Learning How To Learn #

## Week 1 - What is Learning

### Types of Learning Modes
1. Diffused
1. Focused

`note`: Learning something difficult or new - back and forth transition of diffused and focused mode

_**`Mind-Mapping Technique`**_
- write the topic to capture the ideas on diffuse mode


Techniques
- Notes/Flash Cards
- Recall
- Combine practice and repetition
    - undestanding alone will not lead to mastery
    
### Procrastination
1. Cause
    - activates the Insular Cortex
        - same areas associated with pain 
1. Solution
    1. _**`Pomodoro Technique`**_
        1. no interruption
        1. focus
        1. reward after 25 minutes
            - funnel attention onto a more pleasant task
    1. Start and continue working on it
        - neural discomfort disappears when working on it 
    1. Practice

### Memory
1. working memory
    - can hold only 4 chunks
1. long term memory
    - warehouse
    - needs to revisit to become permanent
    - store fundamental techniques
    - takes time and practice
    
_**`Space Repetition Technique`**_
- from short term to long term
- repeating what ur trying to retain over a number of days with gap days 
    - build stronger neural structures
    
### Sleep
- brain cells shrink, causes increase in space between cells, fluid can pass thru and wash metabolic toxins clean
- allows your brain to strengthen important parts of memories even as it erases less important memories 
- allows your brain a chance to rehearse difficult material--going over and over the tougher aspects of what you are trying to learns

### Advices
1. Learning by doing
1. Learning from the experts
1. Asking questions to avert boring discussion
1. General principles that acts of engagement rather than passive listening
1. Jogging to disengage
1. Take notes to retain ideas
1. multi-tasking is context switching
    - not very efficient
1. being in creative environment
1. success is not necessary being smart
1. success is passion and persistence and not giving up


### Components of Habit
1. Cue
   - time of the day, place, emotions, trigger
1. Routine
    - the behaviour itself
1. Reward
    - satisfying hunger, burst of energy, socialization, flavor, sensation, respite from attention
    
**Keystone Habits**
- habits that would change the entire habit of organization or company culture

**Addiction**
- biochemical driven
- neurological rewards

**Habit**
- routine behaviour habit 
- relief from tension
- falls apart during stress and reverts to previous bad habit

**Lifetime Habits**
- can train to self to stick to habit by practicing
- must belief on higher cause
- the value of writing down

_**`Writing down notes/plan Technique`**_
- Basal Ganglia (automatic behaviourial habit) to Pre-frontal Cortex (cognition and thought)
    - grabbing the activity from basal to pre-frontal to analyse and control to play with the cues, rewards

_**`Implementation Intentions Technique`**_

- find where do you find where the behaviours failed
- identify where the problem emerges
        
1. write down the `infliction points`
    1. make it a cue for a new habit
        - e.g. social media browsing
    1. decide what routine to address the bad habit
        - e.g. close the browser
    1. give a reward when doing it 
        - e.g. play games after work 

## Week 2 - What is Chunking

### Chunk
- pieces of information that are bound together and use
- understanding individual piece and merging to get bigger picture
- network of neurons that are use to firing each other
- the `main` idea of underlying principles

#### Steps to Form a Chunk
1. Focus attention on the information you want to chunk
    - avoid distraction due to limited slots
1. Understanding the basic idea you are trying to chunk
    - superglue that helps the underlying memory traces and networks together
1. Practice to gain context 
    - understands when to use the chunk
    - seeing more broadly
    - repeating and practicing with related and unrelated problems
    - Types
        1. Bottom up leanring
            - chunking
        1. Top down learning
            - big picture

#### Components of Chunking
1. creating pattern
    - e.g. speaking individual `word`
    - e.g. studying logistic regression
1. joining the pattern together
    - e.g. joining the `word` into sentences
    - e.g. using logistic regression in neural network
1. practice and repeat
    - e.g. talking to native speakers
    - e.g. applying neural network on hands-on projects

#### Ideas on Keeping Learning Track
1. Recall 
    - trying to remember the key idea after studying
        - learned much deeper level
    - recalling outside the usual place of study
        - strengthening the grasp of the material
    - not just passive `re-reading the notes`

1. Illusions of competence learning
    - study all day long without absorbing because of ineffective study techniques

1. Mini-Testing 
    - assessing one's understanding 
    - `Recall` a form of mini-testing
1. Value of Making Mistakes
1. Deliberate Practice
    - practicing the hardest to gain full mastery

#### Motivation
- hard to learn if your not into it
    1. due to emotions
        - intertwined with perception and attention
        - interacts with learning and memory
        - `need to be happy to be effective learner`
        
    1. due to `neuromodulators`
        - carry information not about the context of information but about the importance and value to your future 
        1. **Acetyclcholine**
            - important to `focus learning` and `attention`
            - long term memory
        1. **Dopamine**
            - found in brain stem inside the basal ganglia
            - controls `reward learning`
            - release when we received unexpected reward
                - affects decision making
                - good at predicting future rewards
            - leads to addiction, craving and independece
                - loss: leads to lack of motivation
                - severe loss: leads to Parkinson's 
        1. **Serotonin**
            - affects `social life`
            - alpha male have highest level
            - closely link to risk taking behaviours
                - voilent crimes have low levels 
                
#### Library of Chunks
- connection or library of neural patterns
- knowledge picture
- collection of different types of concepts


**Effective Learning and Chunking**
1. Transfer
    - applying concepts to other field
1. Compaction
1. Creativity
1. Law of Serendipity
    - keep trying
1. Interleaving
    - practicing back and forth for something that requires different approaches, techniques, field, discipline, knowledge or chunks
    - mixing up learning

**Solution Technique for Problem Solving**
1. Sequential Thinking
    - focused mode
1. Holistic or Global 
    - creative diffused mode
    
**Ineffective Learning**
1. Overlearning
    - pros: can lead `automaticity`
    - cons: waste of time
1. Choking
1. Einstellung
    - rote that prevents finding new solution
    - idea already in mind
    - german for `mindset`
    - cons: 
        - sticking erroneous older ideas/solution
        - deeply entrench by familiar ways of thinking
        - not able to handle new ideas
        
## Week 2 - Procrastination and Memory 
### Procrastination

Causes
- common features to addiction
- rational excuses
- doing unhappy feelings 
- habitual avoidance
    - long term detrimental
    
#### Understanding Procrastination Habit
1. Cue
    - trigger the action 
    - 4 categories
        - location
            - e.g. when near cellphone
        - time
            - e.g. every 1 hour after working
        - emotion
            - e.g. when bored subjects 
        - reactions
1. Routine
    - the action  and habitual response
    - `solution`: 
        1. have a plan
            - e.g. turn off or hide phone 
1. Reward
    - immediate pleasure
    - requires investigation
        - e.g.
            - why are you procrastination?
            - substitute an emotional payoff for the pain point (e.g. procrastination) ?
    - setting reward at specific time for mini-deadline
    
1. Belief
    - may fall back in old habits if belief that system works is not strong
    - develop a new community
    
***Mental Tools and Strategies to Beat Procrastination***
1. Reframing things
    - `note`: non-procrastinators put their negative thinking aside and do the task anyway
    - _**`focus on process not product`**_
        - process 
            - definition
                - flow of time and actions associated with it 
                - simple habits
                - small chunk of time 
            - pros
                - allows from judging self to finishing something
                - more relax into the flow of work
            - e.g. 
                - time needed to answer the test 
                - finishing 1 chapter for online course for 4 promodoros 
        - product: outcome
            - definition
                - triggers the pain that causes procrastination
            - cons
                - **focuses on finishing rather than enjoying**
                - causes more tense
            - e.g. 
                - answers to questions to homework
                - getting the online certificate 
1. Promodo Technique
1. Minimizing use of Willpower
    - uses a lot of neural resources
    - use only to change action to the cue
1. Weeklist list of key task (Planner Journal)
    - reasonably work on finishing
    - create a list before going to sleep for tomorrow activites
1. Commit to certain routines and task every single day
1. Plan the time
    - plan `starting time`
    - plan `quiting time`
1. Have leisure or break time
1. Write down the procastination cues
1. Write down the constraints and limitations for the day
1. Write down the task for the day
1. Deliberately delay the rewards until task is finish
1. Work the most important and most dislike task first
    - at least 1 promodo
1. Trust in the system you created
    - reward or relax yourself without feeling of guilt or incompetence
1. Have a backup plan
    - in case of procrastination settles in or errands

## Week 3 - What is Memory?

### Memories
- memories are not fix
- `reconsolidation`
    - process of changing memories
    - possiblity of implanting false memories
    - occurs during sleep
        - making Space Repeation effective

**Memory Palace Technique**
- grouping things and placing in specific rooms or place in the imaginary palace

## Week 4 - How to become better Learner?

### Tips to become better Learner 
1. Exercise
    - more effective than any drugs
1. Delibrate practice
    - only when brain is prepared
    - reinforce and strengthen brain connections between different regions
    - critical periods related to development of brain like sudden improvements occur in specific time line
        - e.g. language acquisition occurs in puberty
1. Create Metaphor or Analogy
    - the more visual the better
1. Change your thought
    - people can enhance their own neural changes
        - practicing thoughts that use those neurons
        - by changing how we think
    - `perseverance`: the virtue of less brilliant
    - shift mindest
1. Teamwork and collaboration
    - avoid overconfidence
1. Deep Breathing
    - stress releases `cortisol`
        - activates the flight or fight 
    - counters the stress
1. Recall
    - repeating what you just studied in your own understanding

`note`: small working memory means more create
- easily gets input due to diffused mode.
- diffuse mode creates more connections
- doesn't lock up tightly the concepts
        
**Brain Hemispheres/Split-Nrain**
1. right hemisphere
    - reality checks
    - bigger picture perspective
    - unable to gain `aha` insights
    - devil's advocate
1. left
    - creative aspect
    - interprets the world for us
    - cling to what you have done (over-confidence)
    
**`Imposter Sysndome`**
- feeling of inadequacy and incompetence

**`Test Taking Checklist`**
1. do whatever it takes to answer the question
1. make a serious effort to understand the text
1. check solutions with others
1. outline homeowork problem
1. participate in homework group discussions
1. consult with instructor
1. understand the homework problem solutions
1. ask explainations for unclear
1. create study guide
1. outline problem solutions
1. quiz one another
1. review sessions
1. sleep

**`Hard-Start Jump-to-Easy Technique`**
1. Start with Hard first but quickly jump to the easy problem first
    - starting hard loads the focus mode first, switching to easy triggers the diffuse mode
    - move to easy if stuck
