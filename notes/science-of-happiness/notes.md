## Week 1 - Introduction 

### GI Joe Fallacy
- "I know this stuff, I should be good at it"
- "Knowing is half the battle"
    - not true, i.e. fallacy

## Week 2 - Misconceptions about Happiness

### Things that we think matter
1. Good Job
1. High Salary
    - impact is greater in poor nations only
    - Emotional Well-Being (EWB) is not impacted until one reaches > $75,000
    - High income doesn't make any difference after a threshold
    
1. Awesome stuff that we think makes us happy
    - materialist attitude
        - have lower life satisfaction
        - `note`: wanting stuff makes a person worst off

1. True Love or Marriage
    - happier in `1-2 years`, and goes back to baseline
    
1. Perfect face/body/weight
    - `weight loss`: the more we wish we lose weight, the more depressed in the future even if you lost weight 
    - `cosmetic surgery`: it gets worst after the surgery
    
1. Good Grades
    - no changes
   
### Why things aren't making us happy
1. Genetics (50%)
    - already set
1. Life circumstances (10%) 
    - stuff happens messes things up
1. Action and Thoughts (40%)
    - intentional effortful activities


## Week 3 - Why our Expectations are so Bad

    
### ***`Miswanting`***
- act of being mistaken about what and how much you will like something in the future
- **Causes**
    1. Our mind think thinks are going to be better than they are
    1. Our mind don't think of absolutes, thus continues to compare ourselves relative to others
    1. Our mind get used to things unconsciously, thus we keep on looking for more forgetting of what we have  
- **Solution**
    1. Intentionally put habit in life

### Annoying Features of the Mind 
1. the mind's strongest intuition are often totally wrong
    - due to ***`Miswanting`***
    - _`related studies`_
        - people chase things like high salaries, perfect bodies, extreme weight loss, cosmetic surgery, and luxury items because they are convinced that attaining these things will make them happy.
1. the mind don't think in terms of true absolute but in relative only 
    - based on ***`reference point`*** or counterfactual
        - salient (but often irrelevant) standard against which all subsequent information is compared
        - context
    - ***Sources of of Reference Points***
        1. Source/Self
            - previous experience and salary Pay
        1. Other People
            - **`social comparison`**: evaluation of your self relative to other people

                    - comparing self to losers
    - summary
        - **comparing ourselves to others make us more depress**
    - lesson
        - **have a reasonable point of reference and appreciate your current status**
1. the minds are built to get use to stuff
    - analogous to `perceptual adaptation`
    - wonderfulness wanes with repetition
    - based on ***`hedonic adaptation`***
        - analogous to `drug tolerance`
        - process of becoming accustomed to positive or negative stimuli that the emotional effects of that stimulus are attenuated over time
    - _`related studies`_: 
        - getting used to high salary but happiness stays the same
        - happiness in getting married after 2 years goes back to baseline happiness
    - summary
        - **we don't realize that greed and satisfaction never ends**
    - lesson
        - **pursue something beyond external factors and have intrinsic motivation**
1. we dont realize that are minds are built to get used to stuff

        - the tendency to _overestimate_ the emotional impact of a future event both in terms of
            1. ***intensity***
            1. ***duration***
        - higher impact bias on worse or negative events
        - ***2 Types of Psychological Biases***
            1. **Focalism**
                - tendency to just think about 1 event and forget the other things that happen
                - _`related studies`_: 
                    - focusing about the HIV positive diagnosis, but forgetting that the diagnosis made the family closer
            1. **Immune Neglect**
                - forgetting about the `psychological immune system`
                - unaware of tendency to adapt and cope with negative events
    - _`related studies`_: 
        - buying new iphone and not maintaining the same level of happiness
        - breakup is hard and have long emotional effect, but turns out not that bad
        - positive STD test might messed up life, but life turns out alright eventually

## Week 6 - Putting Strategies into Practice
1. Situational Support
    - finding situation that supports you
    - environment and milieu
    - **Techniques**
        1. Fix bad environment
            - get ride of bad environment, people

            - have notes and reminders
            - have good visual cues
            - have good social context and agents around
    - _`related studies`_
        - changing the visibility of things you don't want to do
        - consumption of sweets related to proximity or access
        - visibility and convenience matters
        - whats on kitchen counter affects the weight
1. Goal Setting
    - **Technique**
        1. Goal Specificity
            - having quantitive precision with which a goal is specified
            - _`related studies`_
                - specifying goals have better performance
        1. Goal Visualization 
            - thinking about goals can help achieve them
            - related to **`mental contrasting`**
                - visualization technique involving first of 
                    1. thinking also about the positive future `outcome` in details
                    1. thinking about `obstacles`
            - _`related studies`_
                - thinking about the outcomes and obstacles increases performance
        1. Goal Planning 
            - how to intervene and get thru if situation not in favor
            - related to **`implementation intention`**
                - self-regulatory `if-then-plan` strategy that can lead to better goal attainment
            - _`related studies`_
                - implementation intention increases success `3x` for hard goals
                
    - **Putting it Together**
        1. **`WOOP Method`**
            - **Main Object**
                - to get involve
                - can be use to gain insights
                - can be use to understand things you don't want to do
                - can be use to be fully engage
                - a problem solving technique
            - **2 Terms of WOOP**
                1. Going - Specify a feasible wish
                1. Letting go - To find out if something is feasible or not
            - **Techniques**
                - **`5 minute`** uninterrupted routine
                - Doing **4 x a week** until becomes involved and routine
                - can be applied to different timeframe (long-term, short-term)
                - will take mental effort
                - establish daily ritual, same time same place
                - don't need to be perfect
                - changes with life
                
            - **Mechanism**
                1. Cognitive
                    - creates associative links the future (i.e. wish) with the obstacle
                    - changes the meaning of reality 
                1. Motivation
                    - energy x direction
                1. Negative Feedback
                    - criticism
                    - opportunity to get information on how to fulfill wish
                    
            - **Steps**
                1. Wish
                    - search for the right wish
                    - think about your wish
                1. Outcome
                    - the best possible outcome if wish fulfilled
                    - what would I really feel
                    - imagine and experience in mind to feel it out
                1. Obstacle
                    - is the most `critical` part
                    - potential obstacles from fulfilling
                    - what stands in way
                    - what is it really in my that hinders, no excuses
                    - imagine and experience the main obstacle 
                1. Plan
                    - what would I could do to surmount the obstacle
                    - then create if-then-plan

            - _`related studies`_
                - WOOP method increases GPA of students
                - WOOP method increase physical activity
